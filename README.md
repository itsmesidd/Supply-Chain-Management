## Supply Chain ETL & Analytics Pipeline

This project focuses on building an end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for retail supply chain data. The goal is to transform raw transactional data into clean, structured datasets that can be used for analytics and business decision-making.

### Project Overview
Supply chain data is often fragmented and inconsistent. This project demonstrates how raw CSV-based transaction data can be processed, cleaned, and loaded into structured SQL tables to enable meaningful analysis such as order trends, inventory movement, and fulfillment patterns.

### Key Features
- Extracts raw supply chain transaction data from CSV files
- Cleans and standardizes data using Python and Pandas
- Transforms data into analytics-ready formats
- Loads processed data into SQL tables
- Performs basic analytical queries and exploratory analysis

### Tech Stack
- Python
- SQL
- Pandas
- CSV data

### Data Pipeline Flow
Raw CSV Files  
→ Data Cleaning & Transformation (Python)  
→ Structured SQL Tables  
→ Analytical Queries & Insights

### What I Learned
- Designing simple and reliable ETL pipelines
- Working with structured transactional data
- Writing efficient SQL queries for analytics
- Understanding how clean data models support business analysis

### Future Improvements
- Add automated data validation checks
- Extend the pipeline for larger datasets
- Integrate basic dashboards for reporting
